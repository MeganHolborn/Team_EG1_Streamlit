## Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>

DataMinds team has been hired as data science consultants for a news outlet to create classification models using Python and deploy it as a web application with Streamlit. 
The aim is to improve content categorization for Frontier Times by developing machine learning models to classify articles into categories based on content.  This repository contains the code for the final deployment of the application. The primary stakeholders for the news classification project for the news outlet could include the editorial team, IT/tech support, management, readers, etc. These groups are interested in improved content categorization, operational efficiency, and enhanced user experience.

Streamlit is a popular Python library for building and deploying data science applications, including NLP applications. With Streamlit, you can create interactive web apps for various purposes, such as:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Machine learning model deployment
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
- Dashboard creation

By using Streamlit, we can focus on building our NLP application's logic and user interface, without worrying about the underlying web developmentÂ complexities.
